## Introduction {.smaller}

This presentation describes the final project I did for the Developing Data Products course. <br><br>
For this project, I gathered Zillow home value data on houses in Baltimore's Mayfield neighborhood from the Zillow API.<br><br>
The app is a map that allows you to view a set of homes that fall into a particular price range. 

**Here is a link to the shiny app:**  https://cfabacaxi15.shinyapps.io/project4/

Here is a link to the ui code on my github page: https://github.com/abaxaci15/ProjectFourDDP/blob/main/ui.R

Here is a link to the server code on my github page:https://github.com/abaxaci15/ProjectFourDDP/blob/main/server.R

Here is a link to the README file: https://github.com/abaxaci15/ProjectFourDDP/blob/main/README.md

## Background {.smaller}

- The purpose of this app is to explore home prices in the Mayfield neighborhood of Baltimore 
- To retrieve the home price data, I accessed the Zillow API with data from Baltimore's Real Property dataset at https://data.baltimorecity.gov
- The app will be expanded to include other important home characteristics, such as number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, the year
in which the home was built, and grocery stores nearby

## How to Use App {.smaller}

- To use the app click on the drop-down menu and select a Zillow home value range.
- Then click the submit button.
- The houses that fall into that home value range will populate on the map (see below).
```{r map, echo = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("map.png")
```

## Coding Details {.smaller}

To create the app I used the Shiny APP platform, with ui.R and server.R files. To create the value ranges a user-friendly drop-down box was created on the user interface side. A submit button is also displayed for the user.

The server side is organized around the submit button, which serves as a trigger event (observeEvent). Once the submit button is hit, the code creates a map with the homes based on the value range input.
